        "###Cross-encoders concatenate both inputs into a single sequence and process them jointly through a transformer, allowing full token-to-token attention for richer interactions. They output a direct relevance score but require processing each pair anew, making them slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Why Reranking?\n",
        "We use reranking because initial retrieval with embeddings is fast but not very precise. Reranking with a cross-encoder improves relevance by jointly analyzing the query and documents, which leads to more accurate results for the final LLM response.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Can you give an example?\n",
        "\n",
        "You: Sure. Query: \"How does reranking improve RAG?\" A bi-encoder might rank a doc about \"RAG music festivals\" high because of keyword overlap, while burying the perfect technical explanation. Reranking uses cross-encoders to score query-document pairs deeply, promoting truly relevant docs to top-5 for the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "###What are the benefits?\n",
        "\n",
        "You: 10-30% hit rate improvement, noise reduction, and better LLM context. Retrieval is RAG's biggest bottleneck—reranking fixes that without sacrificing scale, since you only rerank a small candidate set."
